# The following is based on the instructions at: https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/codeql-cli/getting-started-with-the-codeql-cli/setting-up-the-codeql-cli. Follow the instructions at: Setting up the CodeQL CLI

# Prerequisites:
# 1) Install codeql in a tools/ directory that is a peer to the folder containing BenchmarkJava. For example, if you have a git/ folder, which contains BenchmarkJava, BenchmarkUtils, etc., then the tools/ folder would be at the same level as the git/ folder.  i.e., relative to BenchmarkJava, it is at ../../tools/code-ql-home.
# 2) Then the owasp-benchmark database has to be initialized by first running the translateCodeQL.sh script.

# Mac Users: "If you are using macOS on Apple Silicon (for example, Apple M1), ensure that the Xcode command-line developer tools and Rosetta 2 are installed."
## For Xcode command line, run: xcode-select -p 1>/dev/null;echo $?   - If this returns 0, its installed, if 2, its not installed.
## For Rosetta 2, run: lsbom -f /Library/Apple/System/Library/Receipts/com.apple.pkg.RosettaUpdateAuto.bom - And if it returns a list of files, it's installed.

# This then runs the CodeQL scan:
## The following CodeQL query is a bit complex. I had to raise an issue with the CodeQL team to figure out how to do this.
## The issue raised and the answer that documents this query is here: https://github.com/github/codeql/issues/18518#issuecomment-2730684184
